# Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets

# For this project, I'll pretend I am working as data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. The company make apps available on Google Play and in the App Store.

# It also only builds apps that are free to download and install, and the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of the apps determines the revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. The goal for this project is to analyze data to help the developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.

# The datasets that were used in the project are be
# A dataset containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018. You can download the data set from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps
# A dataset containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017. You can download the data set from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps
